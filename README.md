# Dennis Maya | Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio!

> ⚠️ Projects featured here are still a work in progress. I'm actively refining layouts, expanding test coverage, and polishing public presentation.

## 🔍 About Me

I'm Dennis, a software test engineer with a background in manual QA and a growing focus on automation, backend architecture, and CI/CD. I’ve transitioned from hands-on testing into building reproducible systems using Playwright, Node.js, and GitHub Actions. My projects reflect a QA mindset, clean repo design, and a drive to make public work discoverable and scalable.
